# Template for the formula this repository serves as a Homebrew tap.
#
# `.github/workflows/release.yml` substitutes the at-sign-delimited placeholders
# below and commits the result to `Formula/riabuild.rb` on main, which is where
# `brew tap` looks. Edit this file, never `Formula/riabuild.rb` — the next
# release overwrites that one.
#
# The workflow rejects a rendered formula that still contains a placeholder, so
# this comment deliberately describes their shape rather than spelling one out.

  # Homebrew runs on Linux and this formula would install there. It should not:
  # Linux is served by the apt and dnf repositories, and `update.rs` upgrades
  # riabuild through whichever package manager owns the running binary. Homebrew
  # on Linux owns it in a way neither `dpkg -S` nor `rpm -qf` can see, so a
  # brew-installed Linux riabuild would quietly never update itself again.
  #
  # Refusing here makes that a clear message at install time rather than a
  # machine that silently stops keeping up.

      Run `riabuild` to set this machine up and open the Clubria environment.

      riabuild keeps its state in ~/.riabuild and your session token in the
      login keychain. `brew uninstall riabuild` leaves both in place; to remove
      them as well:

        riabuild logout && rm -rf ~/.riabuild
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # Compared against the literal rather than #{version}: riabuild's versions
    # are zero-padded release dates, and this asserts what the binary prints
    # without depending on how Homebrew's own Version renders "2026.08.04".
