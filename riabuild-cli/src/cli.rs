/// riabuild is versioned by release date, not by semver.
///
/// The version comes from the git tag, injected by the release workflow, and
/// deliberately **not** from `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`: Cargo requires valid semver,
/// which forbids both the leading zeros in `2026.08.04` and the fourth
/// component a same-day rebuild needs. Taking it from the tag also makes the
/// tag the only place a version is written down, so a binary that reports a
/// different version than the release it shipped in is not a mistake anyone
/// can make.
///
/// A local `cargo build` has no tag, and gets a sentinel that sits above every
/// real date. That is the useful direction to fail in: it reads as obviously
/// not-a-release, it clears any `minCliVersion` the server enforces, and
/// `update::decide` already leaves a build ahead of the published latest alone
/// — so working on riabuild never triggers riabuild upgrading itself.
